For this project we were tasked with making a web application that takes in two some like databases called an API and extract the information and display it in some way. 

We were given the API’s “https://restcountries.com/#rest-countries

“Which gives a list of information about every country in the world and the other API “https://open-meteo.com/” which gives weather information about countries which are searched by using latitude and longitude values.
